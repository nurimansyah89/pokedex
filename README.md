# PokÃ©dex Clone Development

> This was my experiment project for creating a cloned version of [PokÃ©dex](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/) using React + Typescript

## Getting Started

Please install the following pre-requisites:

- Node JS.
- Yarn.

### Installation

- Clone this repo.
- Run `yarn install`.

### Developing

- Run `yarn start` to start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Run `yarn build` to build all scripts into `build` directory for production usage. **Note: Please change the `homepage` option in `package.json` to make sure you have a correct domain root**

### Testing

- Run `yarn test` to start Jest for shallow or snapshot testing.
- Run `yarn test --coverage` to build a coverage report for the test into the `coverage` directory.

## CI/CD

For better deployment setup and code quality, I'm using **CircleCI** as my CI/CD platform. It's used for automatic deployment and testing.

## Surge Hosting

All of this build was hosted at https://nr-pokedex.surge.sh.
